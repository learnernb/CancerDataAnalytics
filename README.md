# 🧬 Cancer Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a cancer dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and risk factors influencing cancer severity and survival years. The analysis highlights the role of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors in cancer progression.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Perform **descriptive analysis** of the dataset.
2. Determine the relationship between **risk factors** and **cancer severity**.
3. Analyze the proportion of **early-stage diagnoses** by cancer type.
4. Identify **key predictors** of cancer severity and survival years.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

* The dataset includes patient-level information with attributes such as:

  * **Genetic Risk**
  * **Air Pollution**
  * **Alcohol Use**
  * **Smoking**
  * **Obesity Level**
  * **Cancer Stage & Type**
  * **Survival Years**
* Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring data consistency.

---

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing and inconsistent data.
   * Normalized categorical features.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**

   * Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation.

3. **Univariate Analysis**

   * Distribution plots of individual variables (e.g., smoking, obesity).

4. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**

   * Correlation between risk factors and severity.
   * Survival years vs. risk factors.

5. **Visualization**

   * Histograms, Bar charts, Scatter plots, Heatmaps.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

* **Genetic Risk & Smoking** are highly correlated with **cancer severity**.
* **Obesity** and **Alcohol Use** act as moderate contributing factors.
* **Air Pollution** plays a significant role in certain cancer types.
* Early-stage diagnoses are more common in patients with **lower lifestyle risk factors**.
* Survival years are negatively impacted by **combined presence of smoking + genetic risk**.

## 📈 Visualizations (Sample)

* Distribution of cancer stages across types.
* Scatter plot: Smoking vs. Survival Years.
* Heatmap: Correlation between risk factors and severity.

## ✅ Conclusion & Insights

* **Prevention Strategies:** Lifestyle modifications (reducing smoking, alcohol, obesity) can lower risk.
* **Policy Implications:** Stronger pollution control measures can impact cancer cases.
* **Medical Insight:** Genetic screening can help in early detection and targeted prevention.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Apply **Machine Learning models** to predict cancer severity and survival years.
* Conduct **feature importance analysis** to rank most influential risk factors.
* Develop a **dashboard** for interactive visualization.
